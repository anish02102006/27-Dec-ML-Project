# 📊 Instagram Post Performance Analysis (Machine Learning Project)

A Machine Learning project that analyzes Instagram post performance data and explores how different features (like likes, comments, hashtags, posting time etc.) influence reach and engagement. This repository includes the dataset and a Jupyter Notebook with exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and modeling.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Instagram is one of the most widely used social media platforms. Brands and content creators want to understand which post attributes maximize **reach**, **likes**, **comments**, and overall **engagement**. This project uses real data to:

✔ Explore patterns in Instagram post performance  
✔ Visualize correlations between metrics  
✔ Apply basic predictive modeling to understand engagement behavior
